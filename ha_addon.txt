Create a Home Assistant add-on called "AI Sensor Exporter" with the following specifications:

## Core Functionality
Build an add-on that exposes selected Home Assistant sensor states via an unauthenticated endpoint for AI agent scraping.

## User Interface (Setup Side - Authenticated)
- Modern, clean web interface accessible via Home Assistant ingress
- Left sidebar: Domain-based organization (sensor, binary_sensor, light, switch, climate, etc.)
- Main panel: Searchable list of entities within selected domain
- Each entity shows: friendly name, entity_id, current state, domain icon
- Checkbox selection to expose/hide each entity
- Search bar with real-time filtering across all entities
- "Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons per domain
- Save button to persist configuration
- Live preview showing how many entities are currently exposed

## AI Agent Endpoint (Unauthenticated - Read Only)
Serve exposed sensor data at `/api/ai-sensors` (no auth required)

JSON format:
```json
{
  "sensors": [
    {
      "entity_id": "sensor.living_room_temperature",
      "friendly_name": "Living Room Temperature",
      "state": "21.5",
      "last_state": "21.3",
      "last_changed": "2026-02-09T15:30:00Z",
      "unit_of_measurement": "°C",
      "device_class": "temperature"
    }
  ],
  "last_updated": "2026-02-09T15:37:00Z",
  "total_sensors": 42
}
```

## Additional Data to Expose
Include these fields for each sensor:
- `entity_id` (required)
- `friendly_name` (required)
- `state` (current value, required)
- `last_state` (previous value, required)
- `last_changed` (ISO 8601 timestamp, required)
- `unit_of_measurement` (if available)
- `device_class` (if available, provides semantic context)
- `area` (room/area name if assigned)
- `attributes` (optional whitelist: battery_level, temperature, humidity, etc.)

## Technical Requirements
1. **Dual endpoint architecture:**
   - Setup UI: `/` (requires HA auth via ingress)
   - AI endpoint: `/api/ai-sensors` (no auth, read-only)

2. **Configuration persistence:**
   - Store selected entities in addon config file
   - Reload configuration without restart

3. **Performance:**
   - Cache sensor states (refresh every 5 seconds)
   - Return cached data on `/api/ai-sensors` requests (fast response)

4. **Security:**
   - AI endpoint is read-only, no control capabilities
   - Only expose explicitly selected sensors
   - No access to HA token or admin functions from AI endpoint

5. **HA Integration:**
   - Use Home Assistant WebSocket API for live entity data
   - Auto-discover all available entities on startup
   - Handle entity additions/removals gracefully

## Recommended Additions
- **Bulk actions:** Expose all sensors in a domain with one click
- **Presets:** Save/load common sensor configurations (e.g., "Weather", "Energy", "Security")
- **State filtering:** Option to exclude sensors in "unavailable" or "unknown" state from AI endpoint
- **Compact mode toggle:** Minimal JSON format (only entity_id + state) for bandwidth efficiency
- **Refresh rate config:** Let user set cache refresh interval (1-60 seconds)
- **Export/Import:** JSON config file for backup/restore of selections

## Tech Stack Suggestions
- Backend: Python (aiohttp for async, websockets for HA API)
- Frontend: HTML + vanilla JS or lightweight framework (Alpine.js, Petite Vue)
- Styling: Modern CSS framework (Tailwind, or HA's own design system)
- Config storage: YAML or JSON in /data directory

## User Experience Goals
- Setup should take < 2 minutes for a typical user
- Search should feel instant (< 100ms)
- Visual feedback when sensors are selected/saved
- Clear distinction between "setup mode" and "AI endpoint" in documentation

Build this as a standalone Home Assistant addon with proper addon configuration (config.yaml, DOCS.md, etc.).
